Status: Nowhere near complete

This is another hobby project of mine.
I want to create a P2P file sharing system in C++
The main goal is to learn about networking, loe level programming, concurrency, etc. (I know there's a bunch of other p2p file sharing apps out there)
If the goal is to learn, then I think it's worthwhile to tinker with this stuff
There's nothing much here, for now
