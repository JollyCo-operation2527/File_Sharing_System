This is another hobby project of mine. 

I want to create a P2P file sharing system in C++. 

The main goal is to learn about networking, low level programming, concurrency, etc. (I know there's a bunch of other p2p file sharing apps out there). 

If the goal is to learn, then I think it's worthwhile to tinker with this stuff. 

There's nothing much here, for now.

How to run:
   - Type 'make' to compile code 

   - Run the server (./sv) and the client (./cl) 

   - type "upload" to go into upload mode, type "stop" to shut down client and server 

   - To send multiple files: separate each file's name with a ','
