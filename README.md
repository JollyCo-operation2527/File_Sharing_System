This is another hobby project of mine.
I want to create a P2P file sharing system in C++
The main goal is to learn about networking, low level programming, concurrency, etc. (I know there's a bunch of other p2p file sharing apps out there)
If the goal is to learn, then I think it's worthwhile to tinker with this stuff
There's nothing much here, for now

How to run:
    - Make sure to have a directory name "output" in the same directory as the code
    - To send multiple files: separate each file's name with a '/'
